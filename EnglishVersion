Project Name: Multilingual Chat Forum for Global Representatives

Project Overview This project will create a chat platform for delegates from around the world to discuss in their own languages. ChatGPT will act as moderator and allow the blind and deaf to participate.

Purpose

It breaks down language barriers and provides a forum for national representatives to exchange views in their own language. Make discussions accessible to people with visual or hearing impairments. Requirements 3.1 Functional requirements Multilingual support: ChatGPT translates statements from national representatives into other languages in real time. Moderator function: ChatGPT acts as a moderator to facilitate discussions. Visual and auditory support: Provide text-based discussions and, where appropriate, audio and subtitles for visually and hearing impaired participants. Log storage: Store a log of discussions for later review. 3.2 Non-functional Requirements

User friendly: The interface should be intuitive and easy to use. Security: Maintain user privacy and data security. Scalability: Allow many users to access it simultaneously. Performance: Smooth translation and communication in real time. System Specification 4.1 User interface users can access the chat platform through a web browser or mobile app. Users enter text in their own language, and what others say is translated and displayed in their own language. ChatGPT controls things like how discussions progress and the order in which participants speak. 4.2 System Architecture

Front End: A Web application for providing a user interface. Backend: Backend services that handle server-side logic. Database: A database that stores user data and logs of discussions. Translation API: API for real-time language translation. Usage Technology Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Backend: Node.js, Express.js Database: MongoDB Translation API: Google Translate API Mobile App: React Native Restrictions The accuracy of translations in each language depends on the performance of the translation API. Real-time translations can be affected by network delays. ChatGPT's moderation function is intended to facilitate discussion and does not guarantee accuracy or appropriateness. PROJECT PROGRESS 7.1 PROJECT PHASE DESIGN: Design systems and define requirements. Development: Implement the system. Testing: Test the system. Deploy: Deploy a system to a production environment. Maintenance: Operate and maintain the system. 7.2 Timeline

Design: 2 weeks Development: 3 months Test: 1 month Deployment: 1 week Maintenance: Ongoing budget Labor cost: $50,000 Software license: $10,000 Hardware: $5,000 Other: $5,000 Total: $70,000 Risk management Risk: Inadequate translation API performance may delay translation in real time.

Action: Consider using other translation APIs.

Risk: ChatGPT may not be moderated well enough to facilitate discussions.

Action: Update ChatGPT's performance and deploy human moderators as needed.

Risk: Potential invasion of user privacy.

Measures: Strengthen data encryption and security measures.
